        smoothie recipe contains no sweetner. We will only work with the

      <h3>Note:</h3>
      <p>
        It is important to ensure that all <u>seeds are removed</u> from the
        fruits before adding to the blender and eventually starting the blender.
        <br />
        This is to avoid <mark>spoiling</mark> your blender. As some of the
        seeds may be too hard to blend along. This doesn't apply to all fruits,
        but for this particular recipe, it's important.
        <br />
        Also remember to <em>wash</em> your blender before and after use.
