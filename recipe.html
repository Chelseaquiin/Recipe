        smoothie recipe contains no sweetner. We will only work with the
        sweetness of the fruits involved. And above all, it's completely
        healthy.

      <h3>Note:</h3>
      <p>
        It is important to ensure that all <u>seeds are removed</u> from the
        fruits before adding to the blender and eventually starting the blender.
        <br />
        This is to avoid <mark>spoiling</mark> your blender. As some of the
        seeds may be too hard to blend along. This doesn't apply to all fruits,
        but for this particular recipe, it's important.
        <br />
        Also remember to <em>wash</em> your blender before and after use.

      <h3>Nutritional Facts</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>

        </li>
        <li>
          Pineapples are especially rich in antioxidants called flavonoids and
          phenolic compounds. One study of ratsTrusted Source showed that
          pineappleâ€™s antioxidants may have heart-protective effects, though
          human research is lacking.
        </li>
        <li>
          Strawberries may improve heart health, lower blood sugar levels, and
          help prevent cancer.
